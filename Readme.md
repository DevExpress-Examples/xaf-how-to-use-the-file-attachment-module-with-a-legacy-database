# How to use the File Attachment Module with a legacy database


The [File Attachments](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112781/document-management/file-attachments-module) module providesÂ the capability to easily implement a file upload and download functionality in your application. However, the built-in <strong>FileData</strong> class is persistent, and thus requires a separate table in the database to store file contents and names. These specifics make this class useless for XAF applications that must work with a legacy database where a file is stored in a BLOB field of the table with other fields of the same object and in a plain form. Also, the same object may contain multiple BLOB fields for different files. 


## Implementation Details
To handle this and other various scenarios, a non-persistent class that implements the <strong>IFileData</strong> interface can be created.This example demonstrates a possible IFileData implementation in a non-persistent class that actually passes data to and from the owner persistent object, where the BLOB (byte[]) property is declared.

Important notes:
- Since the IFileData implementor class is non-persisent, the object space cannot create its instances. So, we create the onlyÂ instance in the persistent class constructor.
- The IFileData property must have a setter to allow uploading files in Blazor.
- In this example, the file name is not stored in the object, but generated from the object key value. It is only used when the file is downloaded by a user.

Note:
We created this example only for demonstration a possible solution. It doesn't cover all possible scenarios. If you need to support some additional scenario feel free to extend this soluton as required (or create your own one).
